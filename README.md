### Creative Project 2: Chance Operations

For this project, I created a web application named Lyracle. This system transforms the tarot card reading format with music. Rather than traditional cards, this program randomly selects songs to form a three-card spread of past, present, and future.

I used the Last.fm API to curate the system. This API provides access to a database of music information, including the song name, artists, album, and more. Through API calls, 100 songs from their top charts playlist are fetched. From there, the program uses a simple algorithm that ensures every track has an equal chance of being chosen to select three songs. Those three songs are presented as cards with the track and artist name on them.
